	Of course I hope I’ll have possibility to travel and to meet interesting people in future. 
I want to drive a car. 
Now it sounds like a dream but these are things I want to have and to do. 
I am sure that plans begin from dreams. And I hope that my future holds a lot of nice surprises for me! 
	
	What’s more I want to have my own family in future. 
You cannot go far without true close person you love beside you.
 I’m planning to have kids and to live in my own apartments. 
As for our family now is rather big but our flat is small enough and also it’s on the eighth floor I cannot have a pet. 
But I love dogs very much. So, in my future life I will surely have one, because a dog is like a real friend. 
	I’m going to enter university after graduation from school. 
I want to become an economist and to work in bank. 
I know that nowadays there are many economists who cannot get a job. 
But as for me, I really have great interest and talent for Mathematics and economics; 
also I am a hard-working and responsible person that’s why I hope I will manage to succeed. High-qualified specialists are always needed. 
	When I’m thinking about my future I cannot say for sure what it will be like. 
Many of teenagers do not know what they want to become.  
But I am sure that the most important things for me in future will be my profession and family. 
My opinion is that good education is necessary to get a good job. 
Profession is a very important choice that will define all of my future life. I am glad that my parents support me.
